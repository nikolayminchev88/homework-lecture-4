                <p>Rohan was an inland realm. Its countryside is described as a land of pastures and lush tall grassland which is frequently windswept. 
                    The meadows contain "many hidden pools, and broad acres of sedge waving above wet and treacherous bogs,"[2] which water the grasses. 
                    The lands of Rohan are frequently described as appearing like "seas of grass", and are therefore perfect for horses (the Sindarin word roch, 
                    from which Rohan derives, means horse). Karen Wynn Fonstad calculates Rohan to be 52,763 square miles[3] (136,656 km²) in area (slightly 
                    larger than England). At the time of the War of the Ring, Rohan was roughly a third the size of Gondor[citation needed], whose 
                    borders had slowly been shrinking for centuries. 
                    Its warm-continental climate generally brought hot summers and brisk but short winters, marking a midpoint between the harsh winters 
                    of Wilderland (to the north) and the long, subtropical summers of southern Gondor. The winds and air masses can come from almost any 
                    direction and the weather is highly variable in any season. 
                    <br>Borders[edit]
                    <br>The borders of Rohan were (clockwise): 
                    <br> - north: the eaves of Fangorn forest; the rivers Limlight and Anduin; and the walls of Emyn Muil. After the War of the Ring, the kingdom was extended northwards over the Limlight to the borders of Lothlórien.[4]
                    <br> - east: the mouths of Entwash; and the Mering Stream (which separated Rohan from the Gondorian province of Anórien, known to the Rohirrim as Sunlending)
                    <br> - south: the White Mountains
                    <br> - west: the rivers Adorn and Isen, where Rohan bordered Isengard and the land of the Dunlendings. The area of the western border was 
                    known as the Gap of Rohan; here the Misty Mountains and the White Mountains drew near to each other. However, following the conclusion of 
                    the Third Age, "..the realm was extended west beyond the Gap of Rohan as far as the Greyflood and the sea-shores between 
                    that river and the Isen.."
                    <br> Capital[edit]
                    <br>
                    The capital of Rohan is the hill fort of Edoras which is located on a hill in a valley of the White Mountains. "Edoras" is Old English for "enclosures",[5] which Tolkien held to be a translation of an unknown Rohirric name of the same meaning. The city of Edoras was built by Rohan's second King, Brego son of Eorl the Young. Before Edoras was completed, Rohan's capital was at Aldburg in the Folde. Edoras is built at the end of the valley of Harrowdale. The river Snowbourn flows past the city on its way east towards the Entwash. The city is protected only by a high wall of timber, and a one-way road allows access to the city. Just before the gates, two rows of mounds line the road, which are the graves of the former Kings of Rohan. 
                    Edoras is Rohan's only real city.
