                    Sauron settled in Mordor 1,000 years after the end of the First Age of Middle-earth, and it remained the pivot of his evil
                    contemplations for the rest of the Second Age (and throughout the Third Age). In the northwestern corner of this land, near
                    the volcano Mount Doom (Orodruin), Sauron built his great stronghold Barad-dûr, the Dark Tower. After this time, Sauron was
                    known as the Dark Lord of Mordor.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In about S.A. 1600 Sauron forged the One Ring in Orodruin. He then set about conquering
                    Middle-earth. In 1697 he launched an attack upon Eriador (a region far to the west of Mordor), and in particular the Elves
                    of Eregion. Initially he conquered most of Eriador, but in S.A. 1700 he was eventually repelled by the Men of Númenor, 
                    an island kingdom far to the west of Middle-earth. Sauron returned to Mordor, which continued to dominate the surrounding lands.

                    <br> 
                    Almost a thousand years later, in S.A. 3261, the Númenóreans under Ar-Pharazôn sailed to Middle-earth to challenge Sauron's
                    claim to the title of "King of Men". Sauron realized that they would overthrow him if he decided to fight, so he let them
                    capture him and take him back to Númenor, where he eventually caused its destruction in S.A. 3319 (see Akallabêth).
                    Immediately after Númenor's destruction, Sauron returned to Mordor as a spirit (the last of his living being having been
                    bound to the One Ring) and resumed his rule.

                    <b>War of the Ring</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the War of the Rings, Sauron's forces attacked the Free Peoples on a number of fronts. His main army besieged Minas Tirith,
                    the capital of Gondor, but was defeated in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. The victors, the Men of Gondor and Rohan, then
                    sent their Host of the West to the Black Gate. In the Battle of the Morannon, Sauron sent forth another army to destroy the 
                    Host of the West, but then Frodo Baggins destroyed the One Ring and Mordor fell. The Dark Tower, the Black Gate and the Towers 
                    of the Teeth were destroyed. Mount Doom exploded, clearing the sky over Mordor. Both Sauron and his Ringwraiths were apparently 
                    destroyed. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This ultimate defeat of Sauron heralded the Fourth Age. Much of Mordor, especially Gorgoroth, became empty again
                    as the Orcs inside it fled or were killed. However although crippled by thousands of years of abuse and neglect, the land
                    of Núrn was capable of sustaining life, and was given to Sauron's freed slaves.
