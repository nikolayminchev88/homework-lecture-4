                <p>The history of Gondor ("Land of Stone", from Sindarin gond "stone" and dor "land")[2] is described in several of Tolkien's works,
                    with different levels of detail. Within the narrative of The Lord of the Rings, the kingdom is first introduced at the Council
                    of Elrond, with a brief summary of the Second and Third Ages. The events of the latter are elaborated in the appendices to
                    the book, and those of the former in the last parts of The Silmarillion. Retellings at an ample scale of some particular
                    episodes are included in Unfinished Tales.

                    Foundation and the Last Alliance[edit]
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The territory that would become Gondor had been widely colonised by the Númenóreans from around the middle of the Second Age,
                    especially by the Elf-friends loyal to the house of Elendil.[3] When his sons Isildur and Anárion landed in Middle-earth after
                    the drowning of Númenor, they were welcomed by the colonists and their claim of lordship was accepted, while Elendil was held
                    to be the High King of all lands of the Dúnedain.[4] Within the South-kingdom, the hometowns of Isildur and Anárion were
                    Minas Ithil and Minas Anor respectively, and the capital city Osgiliath was situated between them. 
                    Sauron, however, had survived the destruction of Númenor and secretly returned to his realm of Mordor just to the east of Gondor.
                    Soon he launched a war against the Númenórean kingdoms, hoping to destroy them before their power was established. He captured
                    Minas Ithil, but Isildur escaped and fled by ship to Arnor; meanwhile, Anárion was able to defend Osgiliath.[3] Elendil and
                    the Elven-king Gil-galad formed the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, and together with Isildur and Anárion, they besieged
                    and defeated Mordor. Sauron was overthrown, but the One Ring that Isildur took from him was not destroyed, and thus Sauron
                    was able to regain power in the next age.
                    <br> 
                    Both Elendil and Anárion had been slain in the war, so Isildur conferred rule of Gondor upon Anárion's son Meneldil and went
                    north to ascend to the kingship of Arnor, retaining suzerainty over Gondor as High King of the Dúnedain.[5] However, Isildur
                    and his three elder sons were ambushed and killed by Orcs in the Gladden Fields. 
                    Isildur's remaining son Valandil did not attempt to reclaim his father's place in Gondor monarchy, and therefore the kingdom
                    was ruled solely by Meneldil and his descendants until their line died out with Eärnur.
